# Igor_general
Electrophysiology analysis, including abf loading

The main procedure (.ipf) file compiles in the latest version of Igor (8.03B01) a probably all versions of Igor 7 and 8. It is certain not to compile in Igor 6. Getting to compile in Igor 6 would require a faily major rewrite and loss of functionality.

All procedures are contained in a single ipf for ease of loading into an instance of Igor (which is best done by dragging it from a local copy of the git repo).
